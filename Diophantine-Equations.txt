Linear Diophantine Equations

Any equation in the form of a*x + b*y = c where a,b, and c are given and x and y are unknown are known as diophantine equations. Considering only the 
cases when a!=0 b!=0 and c!=0, then the solution only exists when c%hcf(a,b) == 0. 

We could find all the possible solution as follow:


From one solution (x0,y0), we can obtain all the solutions of the given equation.

Let g=gcd(a,b) and let x0,y0 be integers which satisfy the following:

a⋅x0+b⋅y0=c
Now, we should see that adding b/g to x0, and, at the same time subtracting a/g from y0 will not break the equality:

a⋅(x0+b/g)+b⋅(y0−a/g)=a⋅x0+ b⋅y0 + a⋅b/g−b⋅a/g=c
Obviously, this process can be repeated again, so all the numbers of the form:

x=x0+k⋅b/g
y=y0−k⋅a/g
are solutions of the given Diophantine equation.

Moreover, this is the set of all possible solutions of the given Diophantine equation.
