Fibonacci numbers possess a lot of interesting properties. Here are a few of them:

Cassini's identity: 
Fn−1Fn+1−F2n=(−1)n

The "addition" rule:
Fn+k=FkFn+1+Fk−1Fn

Applying the previous identity to the case k=n, we get:
F2n=Fn(Fn+1+Fn−1)

From this we can prove by induction that for any positive integer k, Fnk is multiple of Fn.

The inverse is also true: if Fm is multiple of Fn, then m is multiple of n.

GCD identity:
GCD(Fm,Fn)=FGCD(m,n)

Fibonacci numbers are the worst possible inputs for Euclidean algorithm
